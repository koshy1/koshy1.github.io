And as Bethel's <em>Theologian-in-Residence,</em> Barnabas brings the gifts of the academy to resource the church, and the experiential knowledge of the church to discipline the academy. Barnabas also supports the pastors of Bethel by teaching, preaching, and facilitating creative ministry at the church.</p>
                        <p>Barnabas has over a decade of ministry experience (primarily in Chicago, IL), holds a Master of Divinity from Fuller Theological Seminary, where he is now working on a PhD in Theological Ethics. His academic focus is on reclaiming theology for public good (language, economics, and non-violence) and developing the theological agency of all Christians. For fun, Barnabas enjoys baking bread, loves musical theater (Come From Away, The Color Purple, and Sunday in the Park with George are his favorites), and is determined to learn how to surf before he turns 40.</p>
